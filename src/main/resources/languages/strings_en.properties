tq_rules_text=Trente et Quarante is a French card game where players bet on the winning color: Noir (black) or Rouge (red). \
Two rows of cards are dealt, one for Black and one for Red, and the goal is to guess which color will have the highest value without exceeding 31. \
There are also other betting zones like Couleur and Enverse, which win respectively if the first card drawn matches the color of the winning row or the opposite.\
\n\n\
The fiches with their respective values can be selected one at a time, and the betting zones are active only when a fiche is selected. \
To place a bet, you must first select a fiche and then click on the desired betting zone.\
Placed bets are listed on the left. Click \"Done\" to proceed.
