tq_rules_text=Trente et Quarante is a French card game where players bet on the winning color: Noir (black) or Rouge (red). \
Two rows of cards are dealt, one for Black and one for Red, and the goal is to guess which color will have the highest value without exceeding 31. \
There are also other betting zones like Couleur and Enverse, which win respectively if the first card drawn matches the color of the winning row or the opposite.\
\n\n\
The fiches with their respective values can be selected one at a time, and the betting zones are active only when a fiche is selected. \
To place a bet, you must first select a fiche and then click on the desired betting zone.\
Placed bets are listed on the left. Click \"Done\" to proceed.
bj_rules_text=Blackjack is a popular casino card game where the objective is to beat the dealer. \
The goal is to get a hand score as close as possible to 21, without exceeding it. \
Each card has a value: numbered cards (2 to 10) are worth their face value, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10, and the Ace can be worth 1 or 11, at the player's discretion to avoid busting. \
\n\n\
At the beginning of the game, both the player and the dealer receive two cards. \
One of the dealer's cards remains face down. The player can decide to "Hit" (ask for another card) to get closer to 21, or "Stand" (not ask for more cards) if they are satisfied with their score. \
There are also additional options such as "Split" (if you have two identical cards) or "Double Down" (double your bet and receive only one additional card). \
The chips with their respective values are selectable one at a time, and the betting areas are active only if a chip is selected. \
To place a bet, you must first select a chip and then select the desired betting area. \
Placed bets are listed on the left. Click "Done" to start the hand.
